    <string name="rules"><b>RULES\n\n
        <b>1.</b> Pick one player on your team to be the Muse. Try taking turns as
Muse however you like!\n
2. The team to your left draws 6 Masterpiece Cards and 2 Inspiration cards. \n
3. That team secretly chooses and passes one of those Inspiration Cards
and one of the Masterpiece Cards to your team’s Muse.\n
4. Your team’s Muse reveals that Inspiration card, then gives your team a clue
to lead you to the Masterpiece Card. Your Muse’s clue must follow the
instructions printed on the Inspiration Card.\n
5. The team to your left takes that Masterpiece Card, secretly shuffles
it in with the other five they drew, and then lays them face-up for
all players to see.\n
6. You and your team work together and make one guess to discover which
Masterpiece Card your Muse was handed in step 3. Your Muse can\'t
speak or help you in any way other than by repeating the clue given in step 4.\n
7. Your Muse reveals whether your guess is correct or incorrect. If correct,
your team claims that card as your Masterpiece; if incorrect, the team to
your left claims that card instead!\n\n
Once your team has completed its turn, discard all cards used this turn.\n
Reshuffle the discard pile into the deck if it runs out. Play passes to the
next team clockwise in order.\n\n
<b>The first team to claim 5 Masterpieces wins.</b></b></string>
